# EPOS-ICSC-Jupyter_request
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to make requests to the EPOS Integrated Core Services - Central (ICS-C) APIs. EPOS ICS-C is a European Research Infrastructure Consortium that provides a wide range of geoscientific data and services to the scientific community. The notebook covers the basics of the RESTful API design, and some examples of the most commonly used endpoints, including metadata search, executing the request to the TCS and data download. The notebook is written in Python and uses the popular requests library to handle HTTP requests and responses. The code is extensively documented, and the examples are accompanied by detailed explanations and links to the official API documentation. This notebook can be used as a starting point for accessing and analyzing geoscientific data from EPOS ICS-C or as a reference guide for building custom API clients.
